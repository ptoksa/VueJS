## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- An internet connection to load Vue.js from the CDN

### Running the Application
Open `index.html` in a web browser.

### Application Description

**HTML Structure**

- The application is wrapped inside a `div` with the ID `app`.
- It contains a `header` section with a title.
- The `content` section includes a paragraph to display the message, an input field to edit the message, and a button to reverse the message.

**Vue.js Instance**

- The Vue.js instance is created with the `new Vue` constructor.
- The `el` property is set to `#app`, binding the Vue instance to the `div` with ID `app`.
- The `data` object contains:
	- `title`: The title of the application.
	- `message`: The message displayed and edited by the user.
- The `methods` object contains:
	- `reverseMessage`: A method to reverse the message string.

**Styles**

- Basic styling is applied using CSS within the `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section.
- The `.app` class applies a font-family.
- The `.header` class styles the header section with a background color, text color, padding, and text alignment.
- The `.content` class adds padding to the content section.

## Usage
